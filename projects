        <p>A game jam project by me and Dan aka DanDotPng.
        Dan was responsible for the programming, 3D modeling and environment
        texture work, while I worked on art for UI elements and detail textures.
        The game can be found on its 
        <a href="https://itch.io">itch.io page</a>
        , and a selection of my contributions
        are included in this post!

        <p>Gnar is a map for Counter Strike: Global Offensive (I am working on a CS:2/Source 2 port), created for the 2021 Mapcore
            layout competition. It is a 5v5 competitive-focused defuse map set within an American skate park, heavily inspired by
            movement tech of Counter Strike, my own hobby of skating, and an honorable mention to the Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 multiplayer
            map Grind.
        </p>
        <p>The map can be found by its
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2726958620">Steam Workshop submission</a>
        , and if I can track down any vods or the scoring sheet for the map in the competition, I'll list it below!

        <p>Sakura is a map for Counter Strike: Global Offensive (I am working on a CS:2/Source 2 port), created for the 2020 Mapcore
            Wingman mapping competition. It is a 2v2 competitive-focused 'Wingman' defuse map set in a Japanese town caught in the transition
            into the internet age. It was the first mapping project which I completed the full production process for, from planning and greyboxing
            to creation of art assets and polishing for player experience. It performed well in the competition, placing in the upper half of all
            100+ contestants, an accomplishment I am proud of for the stage in my learning map-making that I was at, and for having done it
            entirely on my own.
