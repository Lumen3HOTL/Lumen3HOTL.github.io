# lana-website
the one and only official website for lana quinn, **3hotl esq.**
probably gonna migrate this to like, digitalocean or smth eventually, so enjoy the code while you can, not that it's really any good.

everything on this site is currently pure static html and css written myself, and i'm pretty sure my css styling is terribly ineffecient but as far as I can tell its responsive and works at most resolutions so... we take those.

please lmk if you like it or have any technical issues!
ok bye i love you <3
