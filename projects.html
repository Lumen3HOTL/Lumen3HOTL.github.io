            <p>Gnar is a map for Counter Strike: Global Offensive (I am working on a CS:2/Source 2 port), created for the 2021 Mapcore
                layout competition. It is a 5v5 competitive-focused defuse map set within an American skate park, heavily inspired by
                movement tech of Counter Strike, my own hobby of skating, and an honorable mention to the Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 multiplayer
                map Grind.

            <p>Sakura is a map for Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:2/Source 2 port TBD), created for the 2020 Mapcore
                Wingman mapping competition. It is a 2v2 competitive-focused 'Wingman' defuse map set in a Japanese town caught in the transition
                into the internet age. It was the first mapping project which I completed the full production process for, from planning and greyboxing
                to creation of art assets and polishing for player experience. It performed well in the competition, placing in the upper half of all
                100+ contestants, an accomplishment I am proud of for the stage in my learning map-making that I was at, and for having done it
                entirely on my own.

            <p>The first map I ever created for Counter Strike in 2017, filling me with much of the love and passion which I have
                for level design today. The initial spark came from experiences with Halo's Forge mode, particularly the fleshed-out
                form it took in Halo 5, but this was where I discovered the power and freedom which dedicated modding/mapping tools
                could bring. This map has no clear theme, vaguely set around a water treatment facility with an under-construction
                expansion, and was never fully detailed. Despite this, it served as an incredible learning tool and holds many
                dear memories in my mind. Currently trying to track down the photos of it which are out there, as I have lost track of
                them over the years.

            <p>Sakura2 was a short-lived wingman (2v2) mapping project which I worked on in 2021. It was a follow-up to Sakura, and
                was somewhat exerimental in the contents of its layout. These layout choices were controversial and made the map contentious
                amongst those who would frequently be roped into playtests for my projects, but ones which I remain proud and fond of and
                stand by to this day. Namely, the map was incredibly vertical and had an eccentric layout for the bomb-site which offered a
                drop-down into water, a crawlspace, and a middle route to enter which saw players asked to fight in more close quarters
                than they are often used to.

            <p>Another short-lived project which began soon before I burned out on Counter-Strike mapping until I created de_Gnar,
                Silicon was another more experimental 5v5 Defusal layout which saw limited testing and iteration. It was set within
                the main R&D center of a prominent tech company, and featured increased focus on one-way drops and distinct layers
                of verticality. While I was quite proud of the odd layout and unique gameplay elements it incorporated, playtesters
                were not as fond of it.

            <p>Polis was a defuse map heavily inspired by Inferno, featuring a main and an "alt" middle route to fight over. The map
                began its existence as a quick note thrown down for the main middle area taken while at a volleyball tournament,
                which would soon get its own standalone blockout. A few months later, a new plan iterating on that idea was drawn out,
                and Polis came into existence. The map was fun to play, but didn't see much development due to burnout with Counter-Strike
                at the time. It is a map which I would like to return to at some point.
